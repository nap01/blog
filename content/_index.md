Welcome to Dungeons & DNS. This is a personal blog that will largely focus on my current project. Most of the time that is RPGs/Tabletop, Security/Defense, and Networks/Technology, but many other topics will spring up and fade away over time.

The Hugo module that this blog uses as a theme is [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog) and it is based on [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). Made with ðŸ’Ÿ by [Jan Raasch](https://www.janraasch.com).

Each page is ~5kb, SEO optimized, and you can **host your blog yourself**. I am hosting it "serverless" via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) & a [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/nap01/blog).
